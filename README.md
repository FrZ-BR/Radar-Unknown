# About
Big thanks to [@AiYinZiLeGong](https://github.com/AiYinZiLeGong) (such a genius). Everthing here is based on his work.

I'm not a prof. programmer, just a noob learns to code. I don't even know the difference between _val_ and _var_. So feel free to optimize my shitty code.

And this is a personal programme based on my usage habit just for fun, so I don't have the ability to slove all your problems or requests. But you can get help from [here](https://github.com/AiYinZiLeGong/PUBG-Radar/issues).

I prefer the neat shapes icons. But if you like item icons, you can try [@PubgKnow](https://github.com/PubgKnown/PUBG-Radar) [@Jerry1211](https://github.com/Jerry1211/PUBG-Radar) or [@SamuelNZ](https://github.com/SamuelNZ/PUBG-Radar)'s fork.
